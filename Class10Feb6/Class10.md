## The PDB database

The [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](http://www.rcsb.org/) is the main
repository of biomolecular structure data. Let’s see what is in it:

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and
> Electron Microscopy.

``` r
stats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```

81% of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray. 13% of structures in
the PDB are solved by Electron Microscopy.

``` r

```

     Total 
    249018 

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

``` r
round(stats["Protein (only)","Total"] / n.sums["Total"], digits=2)
```

    Total 
     0.86 

86% of structures in the PDB are protein.

## Using Molstar

We can use the main [Molstar viewer
online](https://molstar.org/viewer/):

![First view of HIV-Pr dimer with bound inhibitor](1HSG_1.png)

> Q. Generate and insert an image of the HIV-Pr cartoon colored by
> secondary structure, showing the inhibitor (ligand) in ball and stick.

![](1HSG_2.png)

> Q. One final image showing catalytic APS 25 as ball and stick and the
> all-important active site water molecule as spacefill.

## The Bio3D package for structural bioinformatics

``` r
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

      Note: Accessing on-line PDB file

``` r

```

Let’s try out the new **bio3dview** package that is not yet on CRAN. We
can use the **remotes** package to install any R package from GitHub.

### Quick viewing of PDBs

``` r
library(bio3dview)

sele <- atom.select(hiv, resno=25)

#view.pdb(hiv, backgroundColor="pink",
#         highlight = sele,
#         highlight.style = "spacefill")
```

### Prediction of Protein flexibility

``` r
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

      Note: Accessing on-line PDB file
       PDB has ALT records, taking A only, rm.alt=TRUE

``` r
m <- nma(adk)
```

     Building Hessian...        Done in 0.013 seconds.
     Diagonalizing Hessian...   Done in 0.05 seconds.

``` r
plot(m)
```

![](Class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

Write out our results as a wee trajectory movie:

``` r
mktrj(m, file="results.pdb")
# view.nma(m)
```

## Comparative protein structure analysis with PCA

We start with a database id “1ake_A”

``` r
library(bio3d)

id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
```

    Warning in get.seq(id): Removing existing file: seqs.fasta

    Fetching... Please wait. Done.

``` r
#blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

Have a wee peek:

``` r
#head(blast$hit.tbl)
```

``` r
#hits <- plot(blast)
```

Peek at our “top hits”

``` r
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')

head(hits$pdb.id)
```

    [1] "1AKE_A" "6S36_A" "6RZE_A" "3HPR_A" "1E4V_A" "5EJE_A"

Now we can download these “top hits” these will all be ADK structures in
the PDB database.

``` r
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

We need one package from BioConductor. To set this up we need to first
install a package called **“BiocManager”** from CRAN.

Now we can use the `install()` function from this package like this:
`BiocManager::install("msa")`

``` r
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit=TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

    Reading PDB files:

Let’s have a wee peek at our structures after “fitting” or superposing:

``` r
library(bio3dview)
#view.pdbs(pdbs)
```

``` r
#view.pdbs(pdbs, colorScheme = "residue")
```

We can run functions like `rmsd()`, `rmsf()`, and the best `pca()`

``` r
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

``` r
plot(pc.xray, 1:2)
```

Finally, let’s make a wee movie of the major “motion” or structural
difference in the dataset - we call this a “trajectory”

``` r
# mktrj(pc.xray, file="results2.pdb")
```
